VMS Project Setup
Python Installation
====================
1. Download Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/.
2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

MySQL Installation
===================
1. Download MySQL from https://www.mysql.com/downloads/.
2. Follow the installation steps to set up the database server on your system.

Source Code Setup
=================
1. Copy the project source code to a desired folder on your computer.
2. Open the Command Prompt (cmd) in the source code directory.

Virtual Environment Setup
=========================
Check Existing Python Installations
-----------------------------------
1. Run the following command to check Python paths:
   > where python
2. If there are multiple Python installations:
   - Use the desired Python version for creating/activating the virtual environment.

Activating an Existing Environment
----------------------------------
1. Navigate to your environment folder and activate:
   > myenv\Scripts\activate
2. Install dependencies:
   > pip install -r requirements.txt

Creating a New Environment
--------------------------
1. Run the following command to create a new environment:
   > "C:\Program Files\Python313\python.exe" -m venv myenv
2. Activate the environment:
   > myenv\Scripts\activate
3. Install dependencies:
   > "C:\Program Files\Python313\python.exe" -m pip install -r requirements.txt





Generating OpenSSL Certificates
===============================
Install OpenSSL
---------------
1. Download OpenSSL from https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html.
2. Install it on your system (e.g., C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin).

Generating Certificates
-----------------------
1. Navigate to the OpenSSL installation folder in Command Prompt:
   > cd C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin
2. Run the following command to generate a self-signed certificate and key:
   > openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout private.key -out certificate.crt
3. Provide the required details:
   Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:IN
   State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:Gujarat
   Locality Name (eg, city) []:Ahmedabad
   Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:ABC
   Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:ABC
   Common Name (e.g., server FQDN or YOUR name) []:ABC
   Email Address []:dhruv@123gmail.com

Using Certificates in Django
----------------------------
1. Copy the generated private.key and certificate.crt files.
2. Paste them into your Django project directory where they will be used.

Django Services Batch File
==========================
1. Create a batch file in the main project folder with the following content:

@echo off

:: Navigate to the project directory
cd /d C:\Indianinfotech\vms

:: Activate the virtual environment
call myenv\Scripts\activate.bat

:: Verify the virtual environment activation
if not defined VIRTUAL_ENV (
    echo Virtual environment activation failed.
    pause
    exit /b 1
)

:: Navigate to the Django project directory
cd /d C:\Indianinfotech\vms

:: Run the Django server with SSL certificates
python manage.py runserver_plus --cert-file certificate.crt --key-file private.key 10.83.152.5:8000

2. Replace the placeholder paths and file names with the actual project paths and OpenSSL certificate file names.

Explanation:
------------
- `cd /d C:\\Indianinfotech\\vms`:
  This specifies the **Django project directory path**. Replace `C:\\Indianinfotech\\vms` with the actual path to your Django project directory.

- `call myenv\\Scripts\\activate.bat`:
  This activates your virtual environment. Replace `myenv` with the name of your virtual environment, followed by `Scripts\\activate.bat`.

- `cd /d C:\\Indianinfotech\\vms`:
  Again, this ensures you're in the **Django project directory** before running the server.

- `python manage.py runserver_plus --cert-file certificate.crt --key-file private.key 10.83.152.5:8000`:
  - `certificate.crt`: Replace this with the name of the certificate file you generated with OpenSSL.
  - `private.key`: Replace this with the name of the private key file generated by OpenSSL.
  - `10.83.152.5`: Replace this with your PC's IP address.
  - `:8000`: This specifies the port where the Django server will run. You can change it if needed.

2. Replace all placeholder paths, environment names, and file names with the actual values specific to your setup.

NSSM Services Setup
===================
1. Download NSSM from https://nssm.cc/download.
2. Extract NSSM and navigate to the win64 directory in the extracted folder.
   Example path: C:\nssm\win64

3. Open Command Prompt and navigate to the NSSM path.
   > cd C:\nssm\win64

4. Install the Django service using NSSM:
   > nssm install Djangoservices

5. A pop-up window will appear. Fill in the following details:
   - Path: cmd.exe file path
   - Startup Directory: Full path to your Django project directory.
   - Arguments: /c "Full path to your batch file created earlier."

6. Save the configuration.

Managing the Service
--------------------
1. Start the service:
   > nssm start Djangoservices

2. Stop the service:
   > nssm stop Djangoservices

3. Edit the service configuration:
   > nssm edit Djangoservices

4.Restart the service:
 > nssm restart Djangoservices
